Tentative schedule for two hours:

ECVL: (30')
    functionalities

EDDL: (30')
    functionalities

ONNX in EDDL: (30')
    functionalities
    model zoo

Basic examples: (10')
  - MNIST (classification task with CNNs)
    - train + inference
  - IMBD  (classification task with RNNs)
    - train + inference

Advanced example: (10')
  - Imagenet (classification task with CNNs)
    - only inference from a pretrained ResNet in ONNX


Pending:
 - which short example could be used for illustrating the use of ECVL?
