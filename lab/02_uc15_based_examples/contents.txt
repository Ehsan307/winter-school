    - binary classifier: covid19 vs normal
    - multiclass & multilabel classifier: covid19, infiltrates, pneumonia, normal

  - Test scripts with the best model in ONNX to reproduce results

Wednesday morning:

  - Explanation on the code (20')
    - scripts flags
    - how to add models
    - how to add data-augmentation transformations
