# UC15 Lab

Here you can find the contents for the UC15 lab related to a classification task using chest X-ray images to detect COVID 19 and other pathologies.

In the UC15 lab session of the winter school you have to follow the next guides in order to install and use a deep learning pipeline for classification:

- [Pipeline preparation](00_pipeline_preparation.md): Download the dataset and prepare the pipeline for executing experiments. Before this step you should have installed the PyECVL and PyEDDL libraries (you can see how to do it [here](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/blob/main/lab/01_installation/README.md))
- [Run test inference](01_run_test_inference.md): This guide shows how to take a pretrained model (we provide one to test) and run inference on the test split of the dataset
- [Run training](02_run_training.md): Train your own models using the pipeline and learn how to change some of the hyperparameters of the experiments
