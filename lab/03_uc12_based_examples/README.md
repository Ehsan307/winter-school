# UC12 Lab

Here you can find the contents for the UC12 lab related to a segmentation task using images of skin with lessions to segment the affected area.

In order to learn about the deep learning pipeline prepared for the lab you can check teh following guides:

- [Pipeline preparation](00_pipeline_preparation.md): Download the dataset and prepare the pipeline for executing experiments. Before this step you should have installed the PyECVL and PyEDDL libraries (you can see how to do it [here](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/blob/main/lab/01_installation/README.md))
- [Run test inference](01_run_test_inference.md): This guide shows how to take a pretrained model (we provide one to test) and run inference on the test split of the dataset
- [Run training](02_run_training.md): Train your own models using the pipeline and learn how to change some of the hyperparameters of the experiments
