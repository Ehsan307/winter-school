# DeepHealth Winter School 2022

Intense week in which the combination of lectures and lab exercises
will bring participants (1) closer to the use of deep learning and
computer vision in tasks related to medical imaging and other
medical data, and (2) to high-performance computing to considerably
reduce the running times of model-training processes.

From [here](figures/DHWS-flyer.pdf) you can download the flyer to distributed it everywhere (thanks in advance).

| Organised by | [The DeepHealth project](https://deephealth-project.eu), an H2020 funded project with agreement number 825111 |
| Dates | January 24-28, 2022 [here you can find the schedule](figures/schedule.pdf) |
| Location | Only via Zoom (link will be provided to accepted participants) |
| Target audience | PhD and Master’s degree students in AI/ML/DS and professionals from Industry with previous knowledge on Machine Learning. Experience with Linux and *shell-script* is recommended to all audiences types. |
| Registration | Via EventBrite in [this link](https://www.eventbrite.es/e/deephealth-winter-school-tickets-215923251257) |
| Topics | Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging and High-Performance Computing |


The DeepHealth Winter School will include theoretical sessions (master classes)
about the above enumerated four topics, and lab sessions to show attendants
how the software created in the DeepHealth project can be installed and used.

Lab exercises will be guided by junior and senior researchers involved in the DeepHealth project.

        by Frédéric Donnat (Outpost24) and one more from Outpost24

        - A theoretical part consisting of an introduction to the Zero-Trust
          concept with the concrete use-case of LEXIS Platform and the Zero
          Trust Architecture applied to HPC and Cloud infrastructure.

        - A pragmatical part where Outpost24 will introduce the importance of
          a full cybersecurity assessment approach to easily improve the security
          posture and reduce effort to identify, assess and prioritise the
          remediation of security vulnerabilities.


    - **CYBELE: Making HPC more accessible for Agri-food Business** _Friday 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM_
        by Dr. Steven Davy, Head Of Division for Programmable Autonomous Systems at Walton Institute for Information and Communication Systems Science

### Lab sessions

Lab sessions are open to all registered people (i.e., even for those who registered for **master classes only**),
i.e., all attendees can run the non-distributed experiments in their own computers if equipped with one GPU at least.
User accounts to run experiments by distributing the workload on HPC infrastructures will be created only for 10
working of groups of 5 people comming from the 50 attendees registered in the lab sessions.

Before the lab exercises, as the starting point of the lab sessions, we have an introduction to the
[ECVL & EDDL environment for potential developers](lab/00_ecvl_eddl_environment),
scheduled ***Monday afternoon from 3 PM to 5 PM***, and consisting in a 
**presentation and brief explanation of the main features of both ECVL and EDDL libraries**.

Then we will continue with [the sessions to carry out the lab exercises](lab).
