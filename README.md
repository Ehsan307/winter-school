# DeepHealth Winter School 2022

Intense week in which the combination of lectures and lab exercises
will bring participants (1) closer to the use of deep learning and
computer vision in tasks related to medical imaging and other
medical data, and (2) to high-performance computing to considerably
reduce the running times of model-training processes.
