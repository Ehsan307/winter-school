# DeepHealth Winter School 2022

Intense week in which the combination of lectures and lab exercises
will bring participants (1) closer to the use of deep learning and
computer vision in tasks related to medical imaging and other
medical data, and (2) to high-performance computing to considerably
reduce the running times of model-training processes.

From [here](figures/DHWS-flyer.pdf) you can download the flyer to distributed it everywhere (thanks in advance).

The DeepHealth Winter School will include theoretical sessions (master classes)
about the above enumerated four topics, and lab sessions to show attendants
how the software created in the DeepHealth project can be installed and used.

Lab exercises will be guided by junior and senior researchers involved in the DeepHealth project.

### Lab sessions

1. [ECVL & EDDL environment for potential developer](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/00_ecvl_eddl_environment)
    
    Monday afternoon from 3 PM to 5 PM.

    Presentation and brief explanation of the main features of both ECVL and EDDL libraries.


2. [Installation and configuration of ECVL & EDDL](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/01_installation)

    Monday afternoon from 5 PM to 6 PM.

    The lab team will remain available till 7 PM in order to assist attendees to complete the installation on their own computers
    (laptop or desktop with at least one GPU card, with no GPU cards it is not feasible to run the lab exercises scheduled for
    the next lab sessions).

    **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: due to the time required to download and install
    (i) [Anaconda for Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual),
    (ii) the required packages when configuring the `winter-school` environment, and
    (iii) to install both ECVL and EDDL libraries,
    we suggest attendees to try the installation by following the [same guide](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/01_installation)
    we will use during this session.


3. Lab exercises to be run in non-distributed mode using datasets from several DeepHealth use cases

    Tuesday afternoon from 4:30 PM till 6 PM, and Wednesday morning from 9 AM till 11:30 AM.

    Additionally to the use of the computing infrastructure made available by UNITO to a maximum of 10 user accounts,
    it will be feasible to run these lab exercises in non-distributed mode on attendees computers equiped with one GPU card at least.

    Each use case will be explained in the following order using the correspoding slides and the guide:
        
        1. [Use case 15 based on X-ray images from COVID-19 patients and ](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/02_uc15_based_examples)
        2. [Use case 12 based on RGB images from skin to detect and segment skin cancer](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/03_uc12_based_examples)
        3. [Use case 13 based on EEG raw signals to detect epileptic seizures](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/04_uc13_based_examples)


4. Lab exercises to be run in distributed mode using datassets from several DeepHealth use cases and running on a HPC environment

    Thursday morning from 9 AM till 1:30 PM

    Details to be added soon.
